# Early Alzheimer's Detection

This project uses MRI scans from the OASIS database to train a model for assessing Alzheimerâ€™s risk. The model reached an accuracy of 81.0%. Since MRI scans are typically used to support clinical evaluation rather than provide a standalone diagnosis, this level of accuracy is considered reasonable. Over 85,000 samples were used in training.
